      Currently, I work as a .NET Developer at RIPSA, a position I've held since November 2022. I hold a degree as a <strong>University Technical Programmer</strong> 
      from UTN Mar del Plata, and I am currently self-learning React and React-Native.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of my goals for 2024 is to transition my career towards becoming a <strong>Frontend Developer.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      I enjoy continuously learning new things and collaborating in team environments, where I often take the initiative. I am always ready for new challenges, 
      eager to learn from professionals, and support my colleagues. Additionally, I am self-taught and enjoy learning on my own.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am seeking opportunities with international or local challenges that will enable me to continue growing and learning.
