      Currently employed as a .NET Developer at RIPSA since November 2022, I graduated from UTN Mar del Plata as a <strong>University Technical Programmer</strong>. Also, I'm learning React and React-Native on my own.

      I aim to shift into a <strong>Frontend Developer</strong> role in 2024. I love learning new things and working in teams where I can take the lead. I'm always up for challenges and enjoy picking up new skills from experienced folks while helping out my colleagues.
    </p>
    <p>
      Right now, I'm on the lookout for opportunities that come with local or international challenges, giving me room to grow both personally and professionally.
